The bottleneck may lie in the data transfers...
## Data rates
## Data bus
- 151202: QuadSPI through a dedicated microcontroleur?
- 151201: At 5Msps, 12 bits, shall we use SPI or parallel? 
- 151201: SPI is managed through hardware... parallel, not. Has to be managed from soft. Can be an issue for real time, and to avoid loosing samples.
- 151130: Rather be going onto SPI : QuadSPI? Is that managed by the RPi? Common amongst ADCs ?
- 151207: For high speed data acquisition: about 120Mbits/sec: No SPI port will support such speed…. Only the  Quad version… we can use USB 2.0 HS for such huge movement.  A FPGA or FPGA/RISC MPU combination can be the best  solution. Later, once on RPI, the data can be handled. But for so  perfect measurement of times, and value, only a DSP it’s not enough.  
## Signal detection
- 151129: LTC5507ES6 to filter ? A rajouter!
## ADC and DAC
- 151130: Better ADC at LTC2315-12
- AD7356 (ual, 12-bit, high speed, low power, successive  approximation ADC that operates from a single 2.5 V power  supply and features throughput rates up to 5 MSPS.  
- DAC: a simple DAC i2c 
## Different setups
- 151202: A DSP may be sufficient for our needs: is that the case? 
- 151203: Proposed setup
-- Using a a Main controller - STM32F407 + USB High speed PHY ?? 
-- Analog frontend :  1/4 of AD8264 as LNA and VGA + AD9236 ADC. TGC  can be controlled by internal STM32 DAC - that's max 100-point TGC  calibration curve.  The ADC then could be connected to DCMI interface of  STM32.
-- Transmitter: could be HV Pulser and the TR switch - microchip HV7360 + MD0100,  STHV 748 
- 151209: In  looking at the issue, I think that DSP can be implemented. Of  course,  that comes with the sourcing and a bit of programming, but it  should  work and provide some flexibility. 
- 151112: 
-- it'd be interesting to keep a 100M s/s sampling rate.  
-- wouldn't recommend MD1210 and TC2320 from supertex for the pulse  part. Those have a recovery time that is quite long, and can get easily  damaged - not to mention that they may be obsolete.  
-- Wouldn't recommend two VGAs ... difficult to control, with a high risk of saturation. 
# All-in-one chips (YDO)
## 151201 : Electronics
### AFE (Analog front end)
#### Rationale 
It appears that compoonent MAX2082 from  Maxim's could be a great choice because it integrates everything in one chip (Analog Front End, Pulser, TCG (ou AVG pour eux), T/R Switch, ADC, Filtrage) - maybe better exists ?
Note : Pre-existing chips are 8-channels.
#### Resources
- MAX2082 - Maxim  (Pulser +/- 105 V), TCG (ou VGA) , ADC 50 MSPS and filtering (63$ a piece starting at 1000 units)

### Need of a FPGA ?
According to articles and reading, it seems like it will be delicate to proceed without a FPGA for data processing. All "Reference Design" sheets I've read do have a FPGA, or a DSP.... because signals to be processeed are IMHO too fast for a µC.
### Microcontroler
- Microchip - a µC PIC24FJ128GC010 - ADC, 12 bit, 10 MSPS : http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?product=PIC24FJ128GC010
- and its dev board at 100$: http://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=DM240015
- ST ant its ADC 12 bit 5 MSPS  µC STM32F334R8: http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/mmc/FM141/SC1169/SS1576/LN1531/PF258875#
- with its dev board at 10 € : http://fr.farnell.com/stmicroelectronics/nucleo-f334r8/carte-dev-32-bits-stm32f334r8/dp/2424210
- Analog Device has a reference list µC  : 
http://www.analog.com/en/products/processors-dsp/analog-microcontrollers/8052-core-products.html
- At analog device, the best seems to be ADSP-CM40XF with a 16 bit ADC at 2,3 MSPS: http://www.analog.com/en/products/processors-dsp/cm4xx-mixed-signal-control-processors/adsp-cm403f.html#product-overview  and its 2 dev boards:

- I also found some MCU with an internal ADC and a good rate wich seems interesting : http://www.analog.com/en/products/processors-dsp/analog-microcontrollers/8052-core-products.html and http://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=DM240015
# Forks
## Constraints
- 151124: The tech milestone was on Nov 24th '15 -  and we need to have something by mid Feb' 16.
## YDO ideas
- 151125: I'm pretty sure that it's impossible that a microcontroler, raspberry or beaglebone can process this data at a speed above 5Msps.  Most of ADCs have a SPI interface, with a 12-bit ADC at 5Msps we'd need a SPI at more than 60Mbps - not everything can do ! In such a case, a DSP or a FPGA is a must-have.
## LJO/FKA cape
- 151124: let's play with the BBB PRU's and develop a analog+ADC cape.
